⚡ EV Adoption Forecasting
As the number of electric vehicles keeps increasing, it’s important for cities and planners to be ready—especially when it comes to setting up enough charging stations. If we don’t plan ahead, we might face issues like long waits and unhappy users.

In this project, I used historical EV data to build a machine learning model that can predict how many electric vehicles we might have in the coming years. This helps us understand future demand and make better decisions for sustainable development.

🔍 What I Did:
Collected and cleaned data related to EV registrations, vehicle types, and regions

Explored the trends and visualized EV growth over time

Built a regression model to forecast future EV adoption

Shared insights that can support infrastructure planning

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

This is a part of my AI learning journey and a step towards building real-world solutions.
